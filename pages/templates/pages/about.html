        <h3>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Persevere began in 2012, even before it became incorporated as a non-profit organization, with one man’s desire to help others who were less fortunate than he was. Our founder, the Chief Executive Officer in a technology company, found himself in jail as the result of drug addiction. When he emerged from the ordeal, clean and sober since then, he realized that he could earn a living because he had advanced technology skills and the soft skills that help people get and keep work, but many others with criminal records, even those with non-violent criminal records, could not. Doors were closed on them at almost every company to which they applied simply because of their criminal records. Also, most did have the skills necessary to qualify for skilled jobs, so even if they could find a job, it was usually a low paying one, rarely enough to support a family. He started working with men in this situation one at a time, helping them learn computer skills and then giving them a job with his company. One became two, and then many, but he soon realized that the difference he could make one man at a time was valuable, but not as effective as if he could develop an organization to serve many. That’s how it started, and Persevere was registered as a non-profit 501(c)(3)organization in 2014.

Sean Hosman is the Founder of Persevere, building the organization from his own experience as an ex-offender and his desire to help others. For the past twenty years, Sean has pioneered reform in criminal justice systems throughout the United States as the CEO of Vant4ge. He has been a leader in creating, developing, and implementing advanced, system-wide frameworks for evidence-based practices, including tools, instruments, technology, policy and practice, and ultimately, outcomes. Sean started with juvenile justice systems, in 1998, working with the Washington State Institute for Public Policy and the Washington Association of Counties to develop and implement the country's first fourth generation juvenile risk and needs assessment and case planning system. From this initial work, he has continued to develop and implement increasingly advanced implementation platforms, in both juvenile delinquency and adult corrections systems, specializing in state and local departments of juvenile justice and corrections. Sean's work has evolved to encompass the entire continuum of correctional care, or Rehabilitative Life Cycle, specializing in the continuity of data-driven decision making throughout entire systems, from arrest, jail, probation, community corrections, prison or residential supervision, to parole and aftercare. Mr. Hosman holds a Juris Doctorate from Brigham Young University's J. Reuben Clark School of Law and is a member of the Utah and Colorado State Bars, and the American Bar Association.        </p>
