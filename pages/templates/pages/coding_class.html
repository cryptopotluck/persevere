        <li><h3>The program is <strong>self-paced with highly individualized instructor support</strong>. Students who can master the content more quickly can complete certification more rapidly than others. Those who need more time can have more time.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Instruction is provided through <strong>six modules</strong>, each leading to certification. At the end of the third module, participants earn Front End Developer certification.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Once a participant has the Front End Developer certificate he can begin the <strong>work experience</strong> component of the program, <strong>earning money and valuable experience</strong> while still working to complete the rest of the coding modules.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>Meeting the needs of your organization and your clients is our goal. The coding instructional component can be offered in <strong>six, twelve, or eighteen months</strong>, based on the setting and structure of your existing programs.</h3></li>
        <li><h3>The course can be offered in an <strong>incarceration or community-based setting</strong>, including appropriate <strong>security features</strong> for each setting.</h3></li>
