    <li><h4>Persevere’s life skills instruction is <strong>embedded within the classroom instructional day</strong> and the work experience module so the skills are both <strong>learned in context</strong> and in small pieces of instruction so they are more likely to be retained and practiced.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>The mentoring component of the program <strong>reinforces life skills through everyday interaction</strong>, teaching that the skills are truly for living, not just for the classroom.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Life skills instruction focuses on the most important skills needed for success at work and life.</h4></li>
    <li><h4>Persevere uses an evidence-informed curriculum that has been modified for the adult justice-involved population and others who are at risk for justice involvement. There is also a juvenile version.</h4></li>
